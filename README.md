# Status:
- Prototyping builds.
- network test.

# Programing Languages:
- c language ( c99 )
- cmake ( for config build )
- lua ?

# Tools:
- Cmake
- Msys2 64

# Information:
  To create sample file examples for raylib, flecs and other libraries to build tests.
  
  Idea base on minecraft to create base game for voxel in c program language. It be blocks and non block mesh to keep thing simple. It low poloygon style.

# Goals:
- [ ] Need to add examples and docs.
- [ ] raygui to handle entities type of data.
- [x] Physics 3d using the ODE simple.
- [x] Network test using enet simple.
- [ ] raygui sample tests.

## Editor:
- menu
- file system
- json
- object
  - add
  - remove
  - position
  - rotation
  - scale
  - select

# Tests:
- [x] Physics Ode 3D simple test
- [x] enet simple test
- [x] transform 3d hierarchy

# Flecs Samples:
- [x] main_enet_test.c
  - server tested
  - client tested
- [ ] main_transform3d
- [ ] main_ode_test.c
- [ ] main_lua_test.c
